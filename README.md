# Wipe Foundation Rust Plugin
Delete or wipe all foundation owned by player's with a command and provide their SteamID or name.

## Commands
- `fwipe <SteamID or Name>` - Wipe all foundation owned by player's with a command and provide their SteamID or name.

## Chat Commands
- `/fwipe <SteamID or Name>` - Wipe all foundation owned by player's with a command and provide their SteamID or name.

## Permissions
- `foundationwipe.use` -- Allows player to use the command.

## To-Do
I hope other developers can help me to develop and complete some of the things below:
- Prevent delete on multiple player with same name found and returning admin message
- create API function WipeOnBanned ( Wipe Foundation on player getting banned ) so other plugin (like PlayerAdministration) can use this function
